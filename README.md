# RocketSeat_Omnistack11

I've learned some skills of front-end and back-end with the Rocketseat Omnistack week11 by Diego Fernandes!

I've developed a small web application called BeTheHero where the company user posts incidents, using ReactJS. In a mobile version the user finds the posts and chooses what incident it wants to help, using React Native. For the back-end side for the db and business rules I used NodeJS.
